        <p>Ada Lovelace was born in <b>England</b> in <i>10<sup>th</sup> December 1815</i> and sadly passed away
        in <i>27<sup>th</sup> November,1852.</i> She was an English Mathematician and Computer Scientist who was
        recognised by being the first Computer Programmer in the world and also by working hand in hand with
       with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org target: _blank"><b> Charles Babbage</b></a> to invent the general purpose Mechanical
       Computer, <strong><big><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org target: _blank">The Analytical Machine</a></big></strong> Ada was the only legitimate child of prominent
       poet <b>Lord Byron</b> and prominent Mathematician<b> Lady Byron.</b> After her birth, Lord Byron and
       Lady Byron separated a month after and Lord Byron left England forever. He died in Greece when Ada was
       just <i>8</i> years old. Her mother continued to remain  bitter and tried to let Ada gain interest in Mathematics
       and Logic so she could forget about her dad. Despite all her efforts, Ada still had interest in him, 
       naming her sons <b>Gordon</b> and <b>Byron.</b> Upon her death, she was buried next to her dad at her request.
       Despite Ada being constantly ill in her childhood, she took her studies very seriously which led to her being
       very successful in her field of study.
       When she was a teenager(18) her Mathematical interest and talent led to a long lasting friendship relationship
       with Charles Babbage who is considered the <b>"Father of all Computers".</b> She was in particular very interested
       in Babbage's invention, the Analytical Machine. </p>

       <p>Lord Byron expected his child to be a <i>"glorious boy"</i> and was disappointed when Lady Byron gave birth
       to a girl. The child was named after Byron's half-sister, <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org target: _blank">Augusta Leigh</a></b>, and was called <i>"Ada"</i> by Byron 
       himself. On <i>16<sup>th</sup> June 1816,</i> at Lord Byron's command, Lady Byron left for her parents' home 
       at Kirkby Mallory, taking their five-week-old daughter with her. Although English law at the time granted 
       full custody of children to the father in cases of separation, Lord Byron made no attempt to claim his 
       parental rights, but did request that his sister keep him informed of Ada's welfare.
       When Ada was twelve years old, this future "Lady Fairy", as Charles Babbage affectionately called her, 
       decided she wanted to fly. Ada Byron went about the project methodically, thoughtfully, with imagination
       and passion. Her first step, in February 1828, was to construct wings. She investigated different 
       material and sizes. She considered various materials for the wings: <b> oilsilk, wires, and feathers.</b>
       She examined the anatomy of birds to determine the right proportion between the wings and the body. 
       She decided to write a book, <b>Flyology</b>, illustrating, with plates, some of her findings. She decided what
       equipment she would need; for example, a compass, to "cut across the country by the most direct road", 
       so that she could surmount mountains, rivers, and valleys. Her final step was to integrate steam with 
       the "art of flying".
       Ada Byron had an affair with a tutor in early 1833. She tried to elope with him after she was caught,
       but the tutor's relatives recognised her and contacted her mother. Lady Byron and her friends covered 
       the incident up to prevent a public scandal. Lovelace never met her younger half-sister, Allegra, the 
       daughter of Lord Byron and Claire Clairmont. Allegra died in <i>1822</i> at the age of five. Lovelace did have 
       some contact with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org target: _blank">Elizabeth Medora Leigh</a>, the daughter of Byron's half-sister Augusta Leigh, 
       who purposely avoided Lovelace as much as possible when introduced at court.</p>

       <p>Lovelace became close friends with her tutor <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org target: _blank">Mary Somerville</a></b> who introduced her to Charles Babbage
       in <i>1833.</i> She had a strong respect and affection for Somerville, and they corresponded for many
       years. Other acquaintances included the scientists <b>Andrew Crosse, Sir David Brewster, 
       Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday and the author Charles Dickens.</b> She was presented at Court at 
       the age of seventeen "and became a popular belle of the season" in part because of her "brilliant mind.
       " By 1834 Ada was regular at Court and started attending various events. She danced often and was able 
       to charm many people, and was described by most people as being <em>dainty</em>, although John Hobhouse, Byron's
      friend, described her as "a large, coarse-skinned young woman but with something of my friend's features,
      particularly the mouth". This description followed their meeting on <i>24<sup>th</sup> February 1834</i>
      in which Ada made it clear to Hobhouse that she did not like him, probably due to her mother's influence,
       which led her to dislike all of her father's friends. This first impression was not to last, and they 
       later became friends.
        On <i>8<sup>th</sup> July 1835</i>, she married William, 8th Baron King, becoming Lady King. They had three homes:
      Ockham Park, Surrey; a Scottish estate on Loch Torridon in Ross-shire; and a house in London. They spent
      their honeymoon at Worthy Manor in Ashley Combe near Porlock Weir, Somerset. The Manor had been built as
      a hunting lodge in 1799 and was improved by King in preparation for their honeymoon. It later became
      their summer retreat and was further improved during this time. From 1845, the family's main house was 
      Horsley Towers, built in the Tudorbethan fashion by the architect of the Houses of Parliament, Charles 
      Barry, and later greatly enlarged to Lovelace's own designs.
        They had three children: Byron (born <i>1836</i>); Anne Isabella (called Annabella, born <i>1837</i>);
      and Ralph Gordon (born 1839). Immediately after the birth of Annabella, Lady King experienced "a tedious
      and suffering illness, which took months to cure." Ada was a descendant of the extinct Barons Lovelace 
      and in 1838, her husband was made Earl of Lovelace and Viscount Ockham, meaning Ada became the Countess
      of Lovelace. In <i>>1843 â€“ 1844,</i> Ada's mother assigned William Benjamin Carpenter to teach Ada's 
      children and to act as a "moral" instructor for Ada. He quickly fell for her and encouraged her to 
      express any frustrated affections, claiming that his marriage meant he would never act in an "unbecoming"
       manner. When it became clear that Carpenter was trying to start an affair, Ada cut it off.</p>

       <p>From <i>1832,</i> when she was seventeen, her mathematical abilities began to emerge, and her 
        interest in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life. Her mother's obsession with rooting 
        out any of the insanity of which she accused Byron was one of the reasons that Ada was taught
        mathematics from an early age. She was privately educated in mathematics and science by William Frend, 
        William King, and Mary Somerville, the noted 19th-century researcher and scientific author. In the 
        1840s, the mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org target: _blank">Augustus De Morgan</a> extended her "much help in her mathematical studies" 
        including study of advanced calculus topics including the <b>"numbers of Bernoulli" (that formed her 
        celebrated algorithm for Babbage's Analytical Engine)</b>. In a letter to Lady Byron, De Morgan 
        suggested that Ada's skill in mathematics might lead her to become "an original mathematical investigator, perhaps of first-rate eminence."
        Lovelace often questioned basic assumptions through integrating poetry and science.</p>

        <p>Lovelace died at the age of <em>36</em> on <i>27<sup>th</sup> November 1852,</i> from 
        <b><a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org target: _blank">uterine cancer.</a></b> The illness lasted several months, in which time Annabella took command over 
        whom Ada saw, and excluded all of her friends and confidants. Under her mother's influence, Ada had a 
        religious transformation and was coaxed into repenting of her previous conduct and making Annabella 
        her executor. She lost contact with her husband after confessing something to him on <b>30 August</b> 
        which caused him to abandon her bedside. It is not known what she told him. She was buried, at her 
        request, next to her father at the Church of <em>St. Mary Magdalene in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire.</em> 
        A memorial plaque, written in Latin, to her and her father is in the chapel attached to Horsley Towers</p>

        <p>In <i>1840,</i> Babbage was invited to give a seminar at the University of Turin about his 
        Analytical Engine. <big><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org target: _blank">Luigi Menabrea</a></big>, a young Italian engineer and the future <b>Prime Minister</b> 
        of Italy, transcribed Babbage's lecture into French, and this transcript was subsequently published in the BibliothÃ¨que universelle
        de GenÃ¨ve in October 1842. Babbage's friend Charles Wheatstone commissioned Ada Lovelace to translate Menabrea's paper into English. 
        She then augmented the paper with notes, which were added to the translation. Ada Lovelace spent the better part of a year doing this, 
        assisted with input from Babbage. These notes, which are more extensive than Menabrea's paper, were then published in the September 
        1843 edition of Taylor's Scientific Memoirs under the initialism AAL.
        Ada Lovelace's notes were labelled alphabetically from A to G. In note G, she describes an algorithm 
        for the Analytical Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers. It is considered to be the first published 
        algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer, and Ada Lovelace has often been
        cited as the <big>first computer programmer</big> for this reason. The engine was never completed so 
        her program was never tested.</p>
